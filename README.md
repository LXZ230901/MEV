# MEV
Scalable and Interpretable Overlay/Underlay Network Checking via Ensemble Verification


We currently provide the dataset used for the experiments.

The MEV code is located in the batfish-master/projects/batfish-common-protocol/src/main/java/org/batfish/MEV directory. This is an initial version, and we are currently optimizing the code. Subsequent versions will be updated soon.
